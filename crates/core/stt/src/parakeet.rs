//! Parakeet v3 voice (STT) engine — ONNX-based, runs **alongside** whisper.cpp.
//!
//! Why a separate engine: parakeet is an NVIDIA FastConformer-TDT model that runs
//! on ONNX Runtime, not GGML — whisper.cpp cannot load it. We embed the Rust
//! `transcribe-rs` library (the same engine Handy uses) in-process to run it.
//! Because ONNX Runtime is a heavy native dependency, the actual inference is
//! gated behind the `voice-parakeet` cargo feature.
//!
//! Unlike whisper (an external `whisper-server` process Core proxies over HTTP),
//! parakeet is a library with no server, so there is no process to spawn — the
//! "engine" is an in-process, lazily-loaded model. This is the genuinely
//! in-process hot path of the STT primitive (never IPC).
//!
//! The extracted-model **directory** is resolved by the host (it is a `~/.ryu`
//! path the downloader in Core owns) and passed in, so this crate has ZERO
//! dependency on `apps/core`.
